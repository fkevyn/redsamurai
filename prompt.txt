 $threejs-builder Study the samurai asset in public/assets/glb/samurai/samurai_skeleton.glb and the
  animations in public/assets/glb/samurai/samurai_animations.glb .
  Firstly, create an asset index json file that will clearly lay out the models animations and
  state so
  that it can be easily imported into a threejs scene.

$threejs-builder create me a threejs scene with the loaded pirate character
I want this to have an orbit camera and then I want buttons to switch between the different animation states.
Make sure that this is touch control friendly.
LMB / Single Touch - Rotate
Scroll wheel / Pinch to zoom - Zoom
RMB / Two fingers - Pan

Use the public/assets/assets_index.json as the canonical reference for the pirate character.


Use $threejs-capacitor-ios to make sure it can be deployed on mobile.

$threejs-capacitor-ios i want this project to be deployed on an ios simulator
